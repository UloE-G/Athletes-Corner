### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](media/bgcolor.png)

- I went with this colour scheme because the color blue is usally associated with sports and I used white to help contrast between the blue, black, and grey text that will be seen throughtout the website. 

- I only chose two colors because whilst researching mutiple sports websites like Footlocker, JD sports, and the Nike website a maximum of 3 different colors were present at each time.
